== Finite Element Method

@section_finite_element_method explains how the finite element method works for modeling structures using simple building blocks. The method divides a physical structure into small, manageable pieces called elements. Each element is defined by a reference shape (like a tetrahedron) that maps to the actual physical space where the structure exists. The position of any point inside an element is calculated based on this mapping.

For a linear tetrahedron element with four corner points, the displacement at any location within the element is a weighted average of the displacements at those four corners. The weights are determined by specific mathematical functions that change smoothly across the element. These functions are designed so that the element behaves linearly—meaning small deformations are accurately represented without complex calculations.

The method calculates how the structure deforms by examining how displacements change across the element. This involves determining the local stretching and shearing effects within the element. The internal forces generated by this deformation are then computed. These forces arise naturally from the material's response to the deformation and are distributed throughout the element.

Finally, the method determines how the structure will respond to applied loads by calculating the relationship between small changes in displacements and the resulting changes in internal forces. This relationship forms the basis for predicting how the entire structure behaves under different loading conditions, using simple mathematical approximations that become increasingly accurate as the element size decreases.
