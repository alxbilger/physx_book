== Spring

The section @section_spring explains how springs behave under different stretching conditions. For a linear spring, the force it exerts is directly proportional to how much it's stretched from its natural length. When you pull one end of the spring away from its relaxed state, the force acts along the direction of that pull, and the spring pushes back with equal strength at the opposite end. 

In contrast, a nonlinear spring (like a quadratic spring) follows a different rule: the force depends on the square of how much it's stretched. This means the force grows much faster as the spring gets longer. Both types of springs always exert forces that are equal in strength but opposite in direction at their two ends.
