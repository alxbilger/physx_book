== Static Equilibrium

In the section @section_static_equilibrium, the focus is on static equilibrium, where the physical system does not undergo any acceleration. This state is defined as having zero acceleration.

When considering static equilibrium, the second Newton's law states that the force acting on an object is equal to zero. To solve this non-linear equation, we use the Newton-Raphson method by finding the change in position and solving a linear system of equations. The stiffness at each position represents the derivative of force with respect to position. With this information, we can calculate the new position as the sum of the old position and the change in position.
