== Mapping

@section_mapping explains how coordinate transformations—smooth, differentiable mappings between input and output positions—preserve physical consistency during system analysis. Velocities in the transformed system scale with local spatial deformation caused by the mapping. Forces remain consistent across systems because work done by forces is invariant, requiring forces to adjust through the transformation’s spatial scaling. Stiffness splits into two components: one reflecting how local stretching alters forces, and another that projects the system’s resistance from the new coordinate space back to the original. Mass updates via the same spatial scaling mechanism, ensuring kinetic energy remains unchanged. Momentum transforms identically through this scaling. Crucially, Newton’s second law holds consistently because acceleration terms and forces adjust in precise ways that maintain the law’s integrity. This framework enables accurate physical modeling in any coordinate system—such as mapping a mechanical system’s local geometry to a global reference frame—without altering the fundamental physics, making it essential for advanced mechanics applications in engineering and computational science.
