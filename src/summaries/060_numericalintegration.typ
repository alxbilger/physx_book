== Numerical Integration

The section @section_numerical_integration explains how numerical methods approximate solutions to problems where a function's rate of change depends on time and its current state, starting from an initial condition. These methods step through time, tracking the function's values at regular intervals. A key technique involves using multiple past values to predict the next value: if the next value depends only on past values and known function behavior, the method is explicit; if it requires knowing the next value itself, it is implicit. Backward Differentiation Formulas (BDF) are a type of such method, with the simplest version (BDF1) using the previous value and current function rate to predict the next step, and the next version (BDF2) using three values and adjusting the prediction accordingly. These methods solve real-world problems like modeling physical motion (where forces change position and velocity) and heat flow (where temperature spreads through space). For complex equations that cannot be solved directly, the Newton-Raphson method provides an iterative approach. It begins with an initial guess and refines it by adjusting based on how close it is to the solution, repeating until the desired accuracy is achieved. This method also applies to optimization problems, finding points of maximum or minimum values by iteratively adjusting the guess until the slope is zero.
