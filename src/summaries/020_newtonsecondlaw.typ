== Newton's Second Law of Motion

The section @section_newtons_second_law describes deriving an equation of motion from the Lagrangian using Euler-Lagrange equations. A Coriolis Matrix is defined to represent the force terms in the equation. This matrix includes the effects of the system's mass and its time derivative as well as a term dependent on the rate at which the mass changes with position.

The derived equation can be represented as a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for both position and velocity variables. The ODE also includes Rayleigh damping, which is a combination of two terms: one proportional to the mass matrix and another proportional to the stiffness matrix.

This ODE describes the motion of a physical system in terms of its position and velocity, taking into account various forces and damping effects.
