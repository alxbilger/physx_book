== Constraints

The @section_constraints explains how constraints—rules that limit the possible motions of physical systems—are handled in mechanics. Constraints can be of two types: holonomic constraints, which describe positions of objects at a specific time (like a pendulum fixed at a point), and non-holonomic constraints, which involve velocities or higher rates of change (like a wheel rolling without slipping). When constraints exist, the system's motion must satisfy both the physical laws of motion and these limiting rules.  

To solve for motion under constraints, mechanics uses an extended version of the Lagrangian method. This adds "constraint multipliers" that account for the constraints without altering the core equations of motion. For static situations (where objects aren't moving), the solution involves finding positions and forces that satisfy both the constraints and equilibrium conditions through iterative methods like Newton-Raphson. For dynamic motion, the same approach modifies the equations of motion to ensure constraints are continuously followed during movement.  

Simple examples include fixing an object at a specific location (a "fixation" constraint) or maintaining a constant relative distance between two objects (a "bilateral" constraint). These constraints affect how forces and motions interact, but the overall approach—using multipliers to enforce rules while solving for motion—remains consistent across different scenarios. The key idea is that constraints are handled through adjustments to the system's equations, ensuring physical feasibility without introducing new complexity.
